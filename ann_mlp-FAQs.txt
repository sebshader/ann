
Ch_uzi couldn't create error:
ignore it, this object is needed to add GEM spheres in the second example, you don't need to run ann_mlp

error: opening file.net
the ann weights file are normal textfiles but they don't seem to be cross-platform. 
i made those files under win32 so they should not work on osx (on linux?)
