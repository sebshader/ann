nmake makefile.msvc

---------- Linux users:

go to http://fann.sourceforge.net/ and download 1.2 fann libs
compile fann libs from source
if you don't compile from source edit ann/src/makefile.linux 
and set correct PATHs

read ann/src/makefile.linux for more info and edit PATHs

---------- Irix users:

ann_mlp and ann_td have never been compiled on irix

---------- OsX users:

go to http://fann.sourceforge.net/ and download 1.2 fann libs
